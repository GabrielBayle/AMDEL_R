# Supplementary Materials for "Solving conflict over common pool resources through delegation to a stakeholder"

This repository contains all supplementary materials for the paper:  
**Bayle, Gabriel, Farolfi, Stefano, Lavaine, Emmanuelle, and Willinger, Marc (2024). "Solving conflict over common pool resources through delegation to a stakeholder." Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.**

## Repository Contents

1. **Data**  
   - Raw dataset used in the analysis for the paper.
   - Data is provided in `.csv` format for easy import into various statistical software.

2. **R Code for Analysis**  
   - Script written in R used to analyze the experimental data.
   - This script contains statistical tests, models, and visualizations discussed in the paper.
   
3. **oTree Code for the Experiment**  
   - The oTree code that was used to conduct the experiment.
   - This code allows for replication of the experimental sessions, simulating the interactions of participants in a common pool resource scenario with the delegation mechanism.
   - The code is provided for oTree 3 (the sessions were ran in 2021).

4. **Experiment Instructions**  
   - The instructions that were given to participants during the experiment (in French).

## Context

The paper investigates how conflicts over common pool resources (CPRs) can be resolved by delegating decision-making to a stakeholder. This experimental study uses a game-theoretic approach to test the hypothesis that delegating the authority to a stakeholder can lead to more efficient and fair outcomes in managing CPR conflicts.

The experiment was conducted using oTree, a platform for developing and running interactive online experiments. The data collected from the experimental sessions is analyzed using statistical tools in R, with all code and data provided for replication and further exploration.
